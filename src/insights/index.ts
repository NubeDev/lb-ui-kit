// `@nube/insights` — public surface.
//
// The Lazybones "triage findings raised by rules, flows, and agents" machinery, extracted from the
// dashboard so any surface reuses ONE implementation — the Insights page, a dashboard widget (read-only
// or acknowledge), a standalone extension UI. Transport-agnostic: the host injects an `InsightsClient`
// (how to reach the node's `insight.*` verbs) — the shell delegates to its `/mcp/call` bridge; an
// extension delegates to its host bridge; a widget shares the shell's.
//
// Consumed two ways:
//   - `workspace:*` from the lb `ui/` app (the page + dashboard widgets),
//   - imported by a standalone extension UI — `import { ... }` + `import '@nube/insights/style.css'`.
//
// Three layers, adopt what you need: the MODEL (pure), the HOOKS, the OPTIONAL UI. The look is optional
// — a host may bring its own skin and drive only the hooks + model.
