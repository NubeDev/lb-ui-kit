// Load + assemble the source picker from the INJECTED loaders — the PURE async fn (no React). Projections
// off the ONE `loadCatalog` orchestration (system-catalog scope, "Two state contracts, one hook"):
// `loadCatalog` runs every loader the host wired with per-section deny-tolerance; this fn folds the
// READY sections into picker `SourceEntry` inputs and collapses DENIED → empty (the picker's
// existing contract). The explorer skin surfaces the same per-section state VISIBLY; the picker
// hides it behind the empty-group collapse. One loader path, two projections — never a second run.
