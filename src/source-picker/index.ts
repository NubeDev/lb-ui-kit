// `@nube/source-picker` — public surface.
//
// The Lazybones "pick a value from the DB / datasources / Zenoh (live series) / flows / extension
// widgets" machinery, extracted from the dashboard so any surface reuses ONE picker. Transport-
// agnostic: the host injects a `SourceLoaders` (how to reach the node) — the shell delegates to its
// gateway/Tauri clients; an extension delegates to its host bridge. Self-themed via `--sp-*` tokens
// scoped to `.sp-root`, host-overridable.
//
// Consumed two ways:
//   - `workspace:*` from the lb `ui/` app (the dashboard),
//   - imported by a standalone extension UI (e.g. thecrew) — `import { ... }` + `import
//     '@nube/source-picker/style.css'`.
//
// Three layers, adopt what you need: the MODEL (pure), the LOADER hook, the UI component.

// (system-catalog scope). The picker folds the same per-section state into flat entries; the
// explorer skin renders it as a tree. One orchestration (`loadCatalog`/`useCatalog`), two
// projections (`loadSourcePicker`/`useSourcePicker` collapse; `CatalogExplorer` surfaces).
