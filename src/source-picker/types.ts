// The canonical vocabulary the source picker produces + the injected seam it reads through.
//
// This package is TRANSPORT-AGNOSTIC by design (source-picker-package-scope.md): it never imports an
// API client or `invoke`/`bridge`. The host supplies a `SourceLoaders` — a tiny bag of read functions
// returning the row shapes below — so ONE picker works from the shell (gateway/Tauri) and from an
// extension (its host bridge) alike. The result of a pick is a `SourceSelection` (a `{tool,args}` read
// source, a `{tool,argsTemplate}` write action, or an `ext:<id>/<widget>` view key) — never a
// dashboard `Cell`; the host maps a selection onto whatever it stores.
//
// The row shapes MIRROR the node's wire records (the same fields `ext.list` / `flows.*` /
// `series.list` / `datasource.list` return). They live here so the package stands alone; the shell's
// `@/lib/*` types re-export / structurally match these (one shape, not two).
