// The system-catalog MODEL — sections AS DATA (system-catalog scope). The picker model
// (`sourcePicker.ts`) answers "pick a source by label"; this answers "browse the workspace's
// subsystems as a tree." Both share the loader seam (`SourceLoaders`) and the row shapes in
// `types.ts`.
//
// A catalog SECTION is a kind (`"datasources" | "schema" | "series" | "channels" | "insights" |
// "inbox" | "queries"`) plus its label/hint (registry-driven data — never a named case in the
// renderer). A catalog ENTRY is what a click yields — a tagged row the HOST maps onto whatever it
// persists (a Rhai snippet, a SQL table name, a dashboard cell source). The package never branches on
// host meaning (rule 10): it returns entries; the host maps them.
//
// PURE: no I/O, no transport, no React. The orchestration lives in `loadCatalog`; the tree skin in
// `CatalogExplorer`.

 *  kind-agnostic (it renders a `CatalogSectionSpec`'s label/hint + the section's `SectionState`),
 *  so a new kind needs no renderer change.
 *
 *  NOTE: this is the FULL vocabulary the catalog CAN cover (so `loadSourcePicker` projects every
 *  loader it needs off the same per-section state). `CATALOG_SECTION_SPECS` below is the SUBSET the
 *  EXPLORER skin renders today — a host composes which sections its surface shows. `extensions`,
